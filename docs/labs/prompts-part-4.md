## Refactor and improve current application

[Back to outline](../outline.md)

Goal:
  - Refactor code for maintainability, performance, and readability. Apply best practices and optimize the application structure.


### EX 1: Improve current application

* `Internal vs external error`
  ```
  Distinguish between exceptions thrown within the business logic layer and those that may occur in the repository layer, as repository exceptions often originate from external sources. Please clarify how you would handle and differentiate these two types of errors.
  ```

* `Introduce logging`
  ```
  The application currently lacks logging. Add logging statements in appropriate locations throughout the codebase and configure dependency injection to provide an `ILogger` instance where needed.
  ```


# Prompts for Part 4: Refactor and improve current application

- Refactor the BasketService to improve readability and maintainability.
- Identify and remove code duplication.
- Apply SOLID principles to the CatalogService.
- Suggest and implement performance optimizations.
- How would you improve error handling and logging?
- What are the most critical areas for refactoring?
- How would you improve the separation of concerns?
