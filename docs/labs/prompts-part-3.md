## Develop unit tests

[Back to outline](../outline.md)

Goal: 
  - Write and organize unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's core logic.

### EX 1: Analyse test coverage in ApplicationCore

* `Explorer current tests`
  ```
  What can you tell me about the current test coverage?
  ```

### EX 2: Test basket

* `Add business rules test for payment types`
  ```
  Add more tests to cover all the rules in 
  ```
  - Basket.cs
  - BasketTests.cs


* `Add business rules test for payment types`
  ```
  Add business rules test for payment types
  ```


### EX 3: Create buisness rules from test

* `TDD: Create test first and generate Business Rules`
  ```
  Add a test to ensure that total quantity is not the magic number 10
  ```

  - BasketTests.cs

### EX 4: Naming convention

* `Naming convention`
  ```
  Use the following naming convention: MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
  ```
  
  - #folder

# Prompts for Part 3: Develop unit tests

- How would you test the CatalogService for edge cases?
- Add tests for error handling in the payment process.
- What tools and frameworks are used for testing in this solution?
- Suggest improvements to the current test coverage.
- How would you test integration between services?
- How do you mock dependencies in your tests?
